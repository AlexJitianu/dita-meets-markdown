# Basic Concepts of Network Lighting
   
Network light bulbs from your "Remote Network Lighting" work with your light fixtures the same way as standard light bulbs. They are different, however, in a couple of ways:
  
   - The lighting element in the light bulb uses energy-efficient LED technology.
   - The light bulb includes wireless technology that allows the light bulb to connect to a network and be managed remotely using the RemotaLux app.
   
Make sure power to the fixture where you are installing the light bulb is turned OFF.
   
Even in low power networks, be sure to disconnect all devices before performing maintenance tasks.
